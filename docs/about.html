      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        The Coverage Paradox, is a phenomenon of urban rail transport systems
        due to the structure of the system concept. The purpose of this is to
        illustrate the coverage paradox with an interactive notebook where users
        can change the parameters of a rail system and see how it has an impact
        on the door-to-door journey time showing the behaviour of the coverage
        paradox.
      </p>

      <h2>Usage</h2>

      <h2>Methodology and Assumptions</h2>
      <p>
        The aim of this is to calculate the door-to-door journey time for a
        passenger travelling on an urban rail transport system.
      </p>
      <p>The overall formula is:</p>
      <p><span class="math inline">\(T_j = 2T_a + T_w + T_v\)</span></p>
      <p>Where:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="math inline">\(T_j\)</span>
          <strong>Average door-to-door journey time</strong>, the average total
          time to travel from origin to destination.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="math inline">\(T_a\)</span> <strong>Access time</strong>,
          the time spend walking to or from the transit vehicle.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="math inline">\(T_w\)</span> <strong>Wait time</strong>,
          the time elapsed between arriving at the transit vehicle and it
          departing on the journey.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="math inline">\(T_v\)</span>
          <strong>Vehicle time</strong>, the time spent travelling in the
          transit vehicle.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h3>
      <p>
        For this demonstration it is fundementally assumed that the journey
        exists in 1-dimensional space.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is assumed that the population distribution is homogeneous and
        therefore the interstation distance is constant along the line. From
        this it is also derrived that the average distance for any user’s origin
        and destination from a station is a quarter of the interstation
        distance.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no account taken of time taken to walk from the station
        enterance to the platform or impact of crowds at peak times. This would
        normally add some time and would include time to scan tickets and other
        station activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is assumed that passengers arrive randomly and do not plan to arrive
        for a train at a specific time. Therefore on average they will have to
        wait half of the headway between two trains to board their next service.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is assumed that the rate of acceleration and deceleration of trains
        is constant. A more standard method is the Davis equation but this was
        not chosen to be used in this case to keep the user interface simple.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is assumed that vehicles travel with a constant headway between all
        services. Any fluctuations or delay is not included in this
        calculations.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also possible to set the dwell time greater than would be possible
        with the headway. This is a limitation and could be addressed in future
        revisions of the programme.
